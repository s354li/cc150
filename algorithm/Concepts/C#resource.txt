1. class: encapsulation of properties and methods; object: instance of class
2. partial class; sealed class: cannot be inherited; abstract class: cannot be instantiated only be inherited; static class: cannot be instantiated and inheritated
3. struct cannot be inherited; struct passed by value and class passed by reference; struct cannot use garage collector
4. compile time polymorphism; runtime polymorphism
5. boxing: change value to reference; unboxing: change reference to value
6. finalize methods is used for garbage collection and clean up
7. delegate: a variable that holds the reference to a method, function pointer;
   public delegate void AddNumbers(int n)
   delegate are used to declare Events multicast delegate
   publisher and subscribers
8. value type store in the stack and reference type store in the heap
9. custom control compiled code dll; user controls ascx
10. object pool reduces the overhead of creating and re-creating objects
11. sealed methods cannot overridden; sealed class cannot be inheritance
12. indexers are smart arrays allow the instances of a class to be indexed as array
13. attributes and property
